 		<p id="Paragraphe 1">I was late for this assignment and I feel bad for that. I did not expect what happend last week, teaching english remotely to a bunch of 20-year-old IT students for 35 hours really did not leave me as much time as I would have liked. It was an awesome experience, however, and I am very glad Coursera allows its students to take the course at their own pace. I am still unsure how I will be able to submit my work to be reviewed again, but I guess it is not really complicated. I will read the course again from the start so that I understand it better and I get some memories back about basic coding.</p>
