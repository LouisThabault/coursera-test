	<div>This is a block.It will be on its own line.</div>
	<div>This is a second block and it will be on its own line.</div>
	<span>This is a line. Since DIV has to be in its own block, this SPAN will be the starting of a new line.</span>
	<span>However, this second span will still remain on the same line as the first SPAN as there was no DIV between both. Still not sure what this will be used for, though.</span>
	<div>Here is another block, so technically, it will start on another line than the two previous SPAN. Hope this is right.</div>
